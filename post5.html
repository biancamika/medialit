            <p>We all know the term “Don’t judge a book by its cover” very well, yet there are those who still don’t follow this practice. Though this saying is more commonly referred to a physical appearance of a person or object, the main focus right now is giving assumptions instead of understanding the truth. So, why is this being addressed in the first place? What is so urgent about it that it needs to be discussed in this post or article? Basing on assumptions is something that a lot of people, especially our generation today or possibly others, sadly do, which may create false rumors and create a misunderstanding. This needs to stop and how is it possible to even do so? It is possible to do this by not judging events or concerns at first glance, not believing rumors, and communicate or ask about the said concern.</p>

  	<p>First of all, we should not judge or base concerns on what we first hear or see. Judging first impressions is already a huge step on leading to an assumption. Based on experience, it is one of the causes of breaking relationships and starting fights that are fought for nothing but on trying to prove a false accusation true. For example, in the documentary Indolence, a Teenage Syndrome, the original idea of it was that the narrator, or the ones who made the said documentary, wanted to focus on how apathetic students are these days, and like framing theory, emphasizing that laziness and cutting out the fact the students, majority if not all, actually overwork themselves to the point they get into serious conditions. The narrator soon realized that her judgement on her first impression on how she thought how students these days act are not entirely true. How we can prevent ourselves from not basing people by their first impression is to simply not question it at first or decide as if we know everything. Everyone has their own problems to deal with, and we can’t just suspect that a person is doing something because of stereotype or what he or she is labeled to be.</p>

  	<p>Second of all, we should not believe all the rumors or gossip we hear just because it’s well-known or trending. Though it’s a human instinct to try and relate to others because we’re social beings, agreeing with an assumption means we’d also be assuming that it’s true as well. It is similar to, for example, how certain news companies take a trending topic but just a specific part of it and not give an entire explanation to why. This is sadly like the media today, they rather have commercialized reports for the sake of money rather than the sake of importance. What we should do to avoid this is to, of course, ignore rumors and, if concerned, look for the whole picture before deciding on an opinion. It’s better to understand the entire situation rather than to just side with something we do not know much of, just because it is popular.</p>

  	<p>Lastly, communication is key. If we don’t communicate, we won’t be able to understand a certain concern. According to an article made by Moore, lack of communication or an unresolved conflict can lead  to misunderstandings, bad communication patterns or negative interactions, and deterioration or reduced relationship satisfaction. Going back to the documentary, again, the narrator presumed that the students were just slackers and contribute nothing to society. In actuality, they are dealing with their own problematic situations.</p>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
