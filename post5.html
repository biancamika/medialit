            <p>We all know the term “Don’t judge a book by it’s cover” very well, yet there are those who still don’t follow this practice.  This relates to my main focus, which is about assuming instead of understanding the truth. So, why is this being addressed in the first place? What is so urgent about it that it needs to be discussed in this post or article? Sadly, basing on assumptions is something many do, especially our generation today. This can create false rumors and create a misunderstanding. This needs to stop, but is it possible? It is can be done by not judging events/concerns at first glance, being wary of rumors, and asking about the concern.</p>

  	<p>First of all, we should not judge or base concerns on what we first hear or see. Judging first impressions is already a huge step in leading to an assumption. Based on experience, it is one of the causes of broken relationships. Many fights are fought over nothing but a false accusation. For example, in my group's documentary "Indolence: The Student Syndrome", the narrator wanted to focus on the laziness of students. Like the framing theory, this was the only thing emphasized (e.g. sleepiness, starving). In reality, the students were actually "lazy" because they overworked themselves. The narrator soon realized that her judgement was not at all true. We can prevent ourselves from doing this by being considerate. Everyone has their own problems to deal with; we can’t suspect that a person is bad just because of a label.</p>

  	<p>Second of all, we should not believe all the rumors or gossip we hear just because it’s well-known or trending. Even if it's human instinct to be social, agreeing with an assumption means we’d also believe that it's true. For example, some news companies only depict specific part of a trending topic. This can be done without an explanation as to why. Sadly, this is what the media does today. They would rather have commercialized reports for the sake of money. What we should do to avoid this is to ignore rumors. If there's still concern, look for the whole picture before deciding on an opinion. It’s better to understand the entire situation rather than to side with a popular opinion.</p>

  	<p>Lastly, communication is key. If we don’t communicate, we won’t be able to understand a certain concern. According to Moore (n.d.), a lack of communication can lead  to misunderstandings, negative interactions, and reduced relationship satisfaction. Going back to the documentary, the narrator presumed that the students were just slackers. In actuality, they are dealing with their own problematic situations. </p>

    <p>In conclusion, it is actually pretty simple to not assume things. It is pretty sad to know that people these days don’t really realize this. </p>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
