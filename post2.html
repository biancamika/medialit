          <p>There has been a realization that every student has troubles. What is the cause? Stress. Stress is the key factor that happens when your body can no longer handle work. This also does in fact happen to adults. As most people know, stress can kill you. According to a study, there has been more stress on children in high school today than what people had before. Another study shows that students in high school need 7-8 hours of sleep to function.  Unfortunately, there are people who work past midnight to finish studying. </p>
          <p>People balancing many responsibilities have experienced stress. It is caused by many factors. It should be understood that students no longer have time to accomplish everything. A simple solution to this is giving more time to students. However, there are many problems that come in with even more problematic solutions. That may in the end cause a deadly disaster. In the end nothing wil happen if we don’t take action now. We can't improve if we can't do what is right. It's possible to achieve a great goal without hurting us in the process. Most or all of the school’s curriculum and guidelines need to change, especially since we live in a knowledge-based world where everything and everyone needs to be smart to survive. Sadly, we do not teach kids how to be resourceful or diligent with their tasks.</p>
<p> In fairness, the school has been changing its ways little by little, but there is no actual impact on what is right or wrong. Everyone in school believes in procrastination since people are too tired to do their work sometimes. There are so many people who have been resorting to harmful ways to help themselves relax such as self-harm and vices. The community should help and understand why people are doing such things; there are many problems with the school’s way of teaching. There are also many hindrances like an inadequate number of teachers.  The school would also add to their course outline without thinking about how the students could finish it all in a single school year. </p>
<p> Students show their dedication to their talents and skills. However, a gifted student in a particular skill can't also be expected to be the best reader or learner when it comes to different teaching methods. This is what happens in our blended learning in De la Salle Santiago Zobel - Vermosa, where we use our iPads and laptops to learn. One example is flipped classroom, which is where we learn the topics by ourselves with the guidance of the teacher. It must be kept to mind though that there are still so many people who cannot keep up with this. No matter how hard they try, they do not succeed.</p>
   <p>There are already many chances for students to show their many talents and activities. Why not their problems too? We should give the future generation a way to solve these issues.</p>
