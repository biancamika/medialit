  <p>In our generation, every single person has device in possession. Laptops, iPads, mobile phones, television, even possibly an apple watch. However, haven’t you notice how much time we use on these gadgets every single day? According to a survey conducted by analytics firm Flurry, we’re up to 5 hours per day on our mobile devices. What is technology doing to us? Our generation is filled with the power of technology and seemingly, at some point, we unconsciously allow it to take control of our lives. Here are two situations of using technology almost every minute of the day with a bad affect: gamers having a lack of sleep and procrastinating by going on to social media.</p>

  <p>Firstly, we will tackle the issue about gamers having the lack of sleep. Gamers spend their free time playing games and as for me, I spend about 2 to 4 hours playing games everyday. According to the Verto App Report (published February 2016), social media activity touches nearly all mobile app users (99%), while mobile games reach 57% of mobile app users. Games rank second behind social media activity in terms of time spent on devices. That equates to a whopping 1.15 billion hours that consumers spend each month playing games. However, students and working adults are usually the victims of having a lack of sleep. Due to the fact that school or work occurs during most of the day, gamers will tend to play games at night. We end up missing the time and start playing at 10pm and end up realizing its 2am when you finish. Furthermore, this could strain our eyes and cause harm to our health. Using gaming as an excuse for having no sleep is not right. We end up not doing our daily tasks properly and this could even lead to procrastination.</p>

  <p>Speaking of procrastination, this leads us to our second situation. According to Asano (2017), Astonishingly, the average person will spend nearly two hours (approximately 116 minutes) on social media everyday, which translates to a total of 5 years and 4 months spent over a lifetime. Broken down, time spent on social media differs across each platform. YouTube comes in first, consuming over 40 minutes of a person's day (i.e. 1 year and 10 months in a lifetime). Facebook users will spend an average of 35 minutes a day, totalling 1 year and 7 months in a lifetime (some statistics include Facebook, Facebook-owned Instagram, and Facebook Messenger for total time spent on Facebook). Snapchat and Instagram come in next with 25 minutes and 15 minutes spent per day, respectively. Finally, users will spend 1 minute on Twitter, spanning 18 days of usage in a lifetime.With the daily usage of  social media, we tend to distract ourselves from our daily tasks. For example, a student goes on Youtube instead and laughs at Vine compilations instead of doing her assigned homework . Unfortunately, her homework is due in two hours and this can cause the student to be stressed once they start on the homework late.</p>

  <p>Sadly, there are even more different situations that affect our frame of mind and health just because of the impact of technology. Technology will never leave our hands at this point of time as it increasingly gets more advanced with more inventions occurring. We have to beware of the effects of what technology could do to us and, use technology to a safer extent.</p>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
