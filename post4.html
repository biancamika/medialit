            <p>People love to see representations of themselves in all sorts of media. It can be in news, movies, or in social media; any mention of someone’s ethnicity or even country could get one excited. For example, when I was a child, I would light up whenever someone mentioned the Philippines in foreign shows and movies. Even now, I would feel happy when a cartoon character is confirmed to be of Filipino origins. However, before getting further into detail, what exactly is representation?</p>

    <p>Representation is having a likeness for something or someone. It can also be like a symbol for something. For example, a dove could be a representation of peace. So, how exactly does the media include representation? The answer to that is simple. Media can showcase different ethnicities, beliefs, and so much more. This is all because of how diverse our world is. For instance, we have actors who come from different backgrounds. We also have international competitions where teams would represent their respective countries. There are also comic book characters who come from different backgrounds.  These are only a few of the many examples I could name.  However, media can have problems with its way of representation. For example, this could be the misrepresentation of age groups or people of color.  Unfortunately, the issue of  media manipulating presented information will always exist. Since the media is powerful, misrepresentation can affect the lives of innocent people.</p>

    <p>The misrepresentation of different groups of people is a very serious matter. This can potentially affect the daily life of an innocent person. This is because some people think that what the media feeds us is immediate truth. As a result, more stereotypes are born; issues like sexism, racism and religious intolerance are intensified. For instance, men can act as if women are below them (e.g. "They just belong in the kitchen"). People of color are being called slurs due to their darker skin. This is a result of people on shows, movies, or even in music using those offensive terms casually. Finally, those who follow Islam are automatically called terrorists. This is all because of how they are portrayed by the media. No matter how innocent you are, if you happen to fit in a certain category, you can suffer from maltreatment.  It is unfair for many others as well; these are only a few examples of misrepresentation by the media.</p>

    <p>There is always a chance that the information the media gives is manipulated. It always goes through a selection based on what they want the public to see. This is what I learned in my Media and Information Literacy class taught by Ms Airah. Not to mention, I also learned about the framing theory, which I will now be further discussing. The media frames information in a positive or a negative frame, leaving out significant details in the process. If included, these details could potentially change the entire news itself. This is a clear manipulation of information that is evident in news articles, reports, documentaries, and so on. This basically warps the representation of the people and their involvement. For example, great white sharks may be dangerous creatures, but their numbers decreased because of the movie "Jaws". According to an article posted on BBC News (2015), there was an 89% population decrease in hammerhead sharks, 79% in great white sharks, and 65% in tiger sharks between the years 1986 and 2000. This was all after the release of the movie.  In the same article, it is stated that even if sharks attack humans, it is usually because of their territorial behavior. They see humans as competitors and seek to have the humans move away from their area. With all this evidence, I conclude that amount of sharks decreased due to how they were framed in the movie. The species suffered a tremendous loss because of the movie’s success.</p>

    <p>Media representation is powerful nowadays, especially due to its global accessibility.  It can be used for good, or for bad. It is strong enough to destroy images of a race, a gender, a religion, and even a species of animal. The media is currently taking over, flooding consumers with trends and news. We have to keep in mind that the more prevalent it is, the more harm it can cause. Representation in media can be good and bad, but that is all up to us.</p>
