            <p>People love being represented in all sorts of media. Whether it be in news, movies, or in social media, the mention of someone’s ethnicity or even country could get one excited. For example, when I was a child, when someone mentioned the Philippines, Filipinos, or anything related to the country came up on foreign shows and movies, my face would light up. Even now, I still find myself feeling rather happy when something as simple as a cartoon character is confirmed to be of Filipino origins. Though, before getting further into detail, what exactly is representation? Representation is having a likeness for something or someone. It can also be like a symbol for something. For example, a dove could be a representation of peace. So, how exactly does the media include representation? The answer to that is simple. Through media, you are able to showcase different ethnicities, different beliefs, and so much more because of how diverse our world is. We have actors who come from different backgrounds, we have competitions that happen internationally where teams would represent their respective countries, we have comic book characters who also come from different backgrounds, and so much more I could name. Although nowadays, media can have problems with its way of representing anything it could possibly represent. In some ways, this could be misrepresentation of age groups or people of color, and there is always the issue of the media manipulating the information they could present to us. This is of course a problem because since the media now has more power than ever, the misrepresentation of different groups of people can affect the daily lives of innocent people; and there will always be a chance that the information the media gives is manipulated to the wants of the viewers.</p>

    <p>The misrepresentation of different groups of people is a very serious matter. This can potentially affect the daily life of an innocent person, as some people think that what the media feeds us is automatically the truth. Because of this, more stereotypes are born and issues like sexism, racism, and even Islamophobia are intensified. Men in different countries, and sometimes even our own country show signs of feeling as if women are below them or just belong in the kitchen. People of color are being called offensive named simply because of their darker tone of skin since people on shows, movies, or even in music are just throwing those offensive terms around. Lastly, because of how the media, especially the news, is representing those who follow the religion of Islam, there are people who automatically call out those who follow the said religion to be terrorists. There are so many ways that this can affect the regular person who just so happen to fit into that category and can potentially be punished and suffer because of the way media presents these people. It is unfair for them and for so many others as well because these are only three of the plenty of issues with the representation of the media.</p>

    <p>There is always a chance that the information the media gives is manipulated. As learned on our Media and Information Literacy class taught by Ms Airah, information presented by the media always goes through a certain process in which they select what the public will see, and will therefore then present what they should focus on. Not to mention, another lesson learned in the same class would be the concept of the framing theory, which I will now be further discussing. The framing theory is simple, the media frames the news or whatever information they gathered into a positive or a negative frame, leaving out significant details that could potentially chance the entire news itself. This is a clear manipulation of information, more evident in news articles and news reports, though can still be applied in documentaries and such. The manipulation of information basically manipulates the representation of the people or those who are involved into something they could truly not be. For example, sharks are indeed very dangerous creatures, but because of the movie entitled Jaws, the number of the great white sharks decreased following after the movie’s release. According to an article posted on BBC News (2015), there was an 89% population decrease in hammerhead sharks, 79% in great white sharks, and 65% in tiger sharks between the years 1986 and 2000. The movie was released in 1975. In the same article, it is stated that though sharks indeed do attack humans, it is usually because of their territorial behavior. They see humans as competitors and seek to have the humans move away from their area. This information gathered supports my statement that because of how sharks were framed in the movie, the people who saw the movie took action and began to hunt down sharks. This also supports my claim above as well. The species suffered a tremendous loss because of the movie’s success.</p>

    <p>The representation in media is a very powerful thing in this time of age, especially since media is accessible to almost everyone around the world. It has the power to destroy images of a race, a gender, a religion, and even a species of animal. It can be used for good, or for bad. In this time of age, the media is taking over and is flooding the systems of the consumers who definitely enjoy being up to date with trends, news, and more. But, we have to keep in mind that since there is a growing power with the use of media, it could be used for something that could potentially harm others. Representation in media can be good and bad, but it is up to us whether or not we chose to be good or to be bad.</p>

            <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

            <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

            <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

            <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

            <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>

            <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

            <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

            <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
