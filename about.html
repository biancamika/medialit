          <p><span>Kwento Studios</span> is composed of six juniors based in the Arts and Design strand of De la Salle Santiago Zobel - Vermosa. It was formed for a project in Media Literature, but as artists, we wanted to put in our 100 percent. Our documentary is the result of the opportunity we took to make use of our passions for a purpose. </p>
          <p><span>"Indolence: The Student Syndrome"</span> isn't what it seems. At first, it claims to be covering the epidemic of student laziness (with the helpful use of the Framing Theory). However, as the documentary progresses, one realizes that the students aren't as guilty as they seem; they're all just stressed due to school. This film is our response against the school system and its expectations, coming from the pain of real experience.</p>
