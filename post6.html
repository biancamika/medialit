            <p>Can society ever change? Time and time again have we asked ourselves that question. Yet every time we do, it seems we never did learn that hard lesson.</p>

              <p> One must ask themselves on who they really are. Are they defined by their desires? Jobs? Hobbies? A factor of this lies in the modern day society. Many young people often bow down to these stereotypes. At the same time, they despise the status quo. This happens because they want to avoid becoming like a pariah. Our culture shapes our society and it is very evident in the world around us.</p>


    <p>Movies, television, songs and the like all have a sphere of influence. Whatever the creator thinks can be expressed in a form of media. The masses, which consume the aforementioned media, often believe this as a truth in a sense. Western movies often stereotype blondes as “stupid” sex symbols, while “macho” white males are heroes. It’s peculiar to point out how poor representation translates onto the big screen and its mobile counterparts. This is because not many are aware of this.</p>

    <p>Society places stereotypes not only on race, but on subjects as well. For example, Art and Communication majors are discouraged in Asian households. This can be linked to a stigma of majors that are seen as unsuccessful in jobseeking. Passion and desire are not well understood from an outside perspective. A STEM track student can be seen as ambitious “leader to new discovery”. An ABM can be seen as a “good business person” in the future. These implicated jobs give out a large income. Meanwhile, A&D students struggle with the persecution of being “academically talentless and rebellious.”</p>

    <p>There is at least a kernel of truth behind every rumour and myth, but it is not right to say it is good for society as a whole. Stereotypes should not be society’s basis for character judgement. Occupation and strand selection do not constantly reflect one's personality and desires.</p>

    <p>Society is a reflection of ourselves. It lives in our culture and eyes. One can never escape judgement fully, but perhaps we ourselves, the new generation, can rectify that little by little. Just as society is a mirror, our future will mirror the actions of people. Society can change if people can change.</p>
